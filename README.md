# Data Structures
This is a long overdue project. I've been working on creating a solid collection of Data Structures in C that I can drop into other projects of mine. I've built too many one-off HashTables and Linked-Lists to justify procrastinating the abstract implementations.

# Structures
* List
This directory contains a faily robust implementation of an abstract, Linked-List Data Structure. I fold this List into the "under-the-hood" components of many other structures here.
* HashTable
This directory contains an abstract implementation of the HashTable. (Table! not Map.)
* Queue
Simple overlay on List to implement a Queue.

# Helpers
