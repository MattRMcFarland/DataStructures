# Dictionary
Who doesn't loving having a String key HashMap with abstract values? A dictionary is super useful, and I wish I had built this a long time ago.

## Usage
The dictionary is actually just a wrapper around the HashMap structure with set String keys. It lacks the HashMapIterator though. I could add that if needed.

### Examples
See `./DictionaryTest.c`

## Documentation Notes
